# time_series_project

### Project Goals
- your company is running multiple different experiments, some drug trials, some testing different fitness equipment, and some "very ethical" human experimentation
- everyone in every experiment wears a fitbit
- no one seems to have time for smalltalk
- everyone on staff has a fitbit

- data is from a single individual

# Deliverables
- Peekadata
  - What can we say about the indidividual wearing the ftbit?
  
- Predictions of the two missing weeks

- Two slides with at least one visualization

- A notebook of our analysis

- Tidy Data Set


# Thoughts
- Holt, Prophet
- Calorie/Step to check for running
- Active Calories minus burned calories
  - which should be flat
